You can explore a web demo at https://enellis.github.io/bevy_lorenz_system/, built from
the `performance` branch with a custom GPU instancing pipeline. For now, I won't merge
these changes into the main branch, as the current version is simpler, makes more use
of Bevy's ECS, and provides enough performance in most cases.
